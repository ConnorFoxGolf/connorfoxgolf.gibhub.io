                        During the summer of 2019, I returned to Garmin, this time in the Outdoor department, on the high-level software team responsible for the outdoor smartwatches. The focus of my internship was developing graphical representations of in-activity metrics for the next generation of outdoor and fitness smartwatches. In other words, I created data fields that included gauges, graphs, dials, etc. to visually represent the data available to the customer during activities. Another feature that I worked on was implementing stealth mode on the Instinct Tactical. This feature hides GPS data from external use in order to comply with military regulations while still allowing all on-device features to remain functional.

                        For my first internship I worked at Garmin International in the Automotive OEM department as a software engineer intern during the summer of 2018. I was on the navigation app UI team and I primarily worked on building developer tools to increase productivity. My first major project was to create a tool to automatically download all libraries necessary for debugging off of an automotive head unit after a software crash. This effectively eliminated a 15 minute manual step from the debugging proces. My largest project was to develop an automated testing framework to simulate interactions between Garmin's navigation app and the rest of the head unit. I also implemented multiple customer facing features such as providing screenshot previews of map locations.

Lasecki</a>. My most recent project was on the generalization of image annotation tools which led to developing image property categories and task requirement categories that are found across domains of image annotation tasks. From these categories, we developed a test harness to guide the design of image annotation tools and testbeds that wish to generalize across a range of domains. Previously, I worked on a project to improve the accuracy of a image annotation tool by adding features to the user interface. The tool was used to aggragate crowd workers responses for a particle filtering task to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images for use in training autonomous vehicles. Initial testing with expert annotators showed that our improvements led to a 30% increase in accuracy.

                        When I joined the <a href="https://mrover.org">Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover)</a>, I was first beginning my career as a computer scientist. Over the past two years I have grown both technically and personally through contributing to the development of the rover's codebase. A large part of my learning came through the mentorship of more senior members on the team. As I enter the final year of my undergraduate studies, it is now my responsiblity to pass on my knowledge to the younger members. I am doing this through both providing one-on-one mentoring to students and by presenting technical material to the team. I am also tasked with providing feedback at design reviews and advising the new team leadership based on my past experiences on the team.

                        I was named the lead of the Autonomous Navigation subteam at the end of my first year on the <a href="https://mrover.org">Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover)</a>. My primary responsibility was the successful design and implementation of the autonomous navigation program. This was something that I was well prepared for and feel that I excelled at. My other major responsibility and biggest challenge was managing a team of 19 other students with varying programming backgrounds. My first full semester as lead, I struggled greatly to bring out the best in my members due to a steep learning curve in our teams tools and a lack of experience on my part in properly delegating tasks. After many failures, I began learning how to better lead the team to find success through greater individual efforts. This included better time management, communication, and team culture. Through pushing my members to work outside of their comfort zones and take on larger roles and responsibilities, I improved their confidence. This increased not only the overall productivity of our team, but also allowed each member to contribute more than they believed they were capable of. As I hand over the reigns to the next lead, I hope to continue aiding our team's growth by sharing my past successes and failures.

                        I joined the <a href="https://mrover.org">Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover)</a> in the fall of 2017. MRover is a student run team comprised of individuals across various disciplines at the University of Michigan that designs, builds, and tests a mars rover for competition at the <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org">University Rover Challenge</a> every summer. During my first year on MRover, I joined the Autonomous Navigation subteam where I, along with two other members, was tasked with developing the initial state machine that executed all navigation logic for autonomous mode on the rover. The main goal was to develop code to autonomously drive the rover between marked waypoints avoiding any obstacles in our path. This was an extremely challenging project for us, but, after many iterations, we developed a functional program. While autonomy mode worked extremely well in our custom built simulator, the integration with the computer vision system and odometry sensors limited our performance at competition. Thus, I turned our focus for the following year to improving the robustness of the system in the real world despite having imperfect inputs. We gutted our search algorithm and redesigned it to work in a way that reduced false-negatives, by adding strategic pauses, and handled false-positive without discarding previous work done. I also designed a sensor fusion algorithm to increase the accuracy of our location and heading estimates by using all sensor data to calculate multiple estimates and weigh them based on our confidence in each estimate. While I have maintained the current version of our similator, I am currently working with a group of members to develop the next iteration which will add abilities such as simulating real world noise and running automated test cases. I am also working with a group to add ultra-sonic and time-of-flight sensors to the rover to add an additional layer of object detection to the rover and add support for detecting steep dropoffs in our path of travel.

                        In the winter semester of 2019, I took Conversational Artificial Intelligence for my senior design class where I built <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fH7zBtLAE_brbpPvGrfjnIudYgc8P53vFjYzqvAg0LI/edit?usp=sharing">My Instructional Assistant (Mia)</a> with a small team of students. Mia is a virtual assistant to tutor students in math (the current version of Mia focuses on the four basic operators). Mia's capabilities include giving concept explanations, providing example problems with solutions, providing practice problems, checking the correctness of answers, and walking students through the solutions of problems.
